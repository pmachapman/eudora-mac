In order to make Eudora work as well as possible, it’s important that we know how people use it. We ask users for this information at random. Looks like it’s your turn. If you’re open to helping us this way, all you have to do is click “Generate Info” below and a message will be created. You can review the contents of the message if you like, and then send it to us or not -- that’s up to you.We value our privacy; we’re pretty sure you value yours. So we want you to know what we’ll be collecting and give you a chance to eliminate anything you don’t want to send. Simply uncheck the boxes next to any information you’d rather not send.Please understand that as soon as we receive your email, we will throw away the headers that identify the mail as coming from you. You see, we don’t actually need to know who you are to find your information helpful. So we promise to protect your privacy and turn you into “just a number.” :-)
