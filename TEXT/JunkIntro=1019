At least one junk mail identification tool is installed.The way Eudora deals with junk mail is that it's put in a mailbox called "Junk". Your filters are not run on it, so it won't be mixed in with your other mail. You can open the Junk mailbox, and retrieve messages that aren't really junk, and have them filtered or transfer them or whatever you like.Mail in your Junk mailbox will only be kept for 30 days. After that, we delete it so that it doesn't take up space on your computer.Would you like to automatically put junk mail in your Junk mailbox?
