Probably inadvertent, but Eudora has determined that something is covering all or a significant portion of an ad. The software is designed to notify you when this happens (Eudora’s just doing its job).  If you uncover the ad, this window won’t keep popping up. You’d like that, right?We’re always working on good stuff back at the home office, and it’s the ads in Eudora that pay the bills while we continue to develop the software.  We’ve worked hard to make sure the advertising isn’t annoying and we genuinely hope that you are not deliberately trying to cover the ads because they’re bothering you.  Of course, you can pay us for Eudora by choosing “Payment & Registration” from the “Help” menu and clicking on “Paid Mode (costs money, no ads).”  Or you can remove whatever is obscuring the ad and we’ll shut up.
