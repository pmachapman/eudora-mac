Eudora is licensed in three ways. If you have purchased a registration code & registered it within the last 12 months, click the “Enter Code” button below and Eudora will install in Paid mode. In Paid mode, you get the full power of Eudora, including SpamWatch, a suite of automatic spam-fighting tools, plus 12 months of updates and live technical support; all in an advertising-free environment.Without this registration code, this copy will install in Sponsored mode and will display ads, and will not include SpamWatch or live technical support. However, we have done our best to present the ads in a way that respects the work you do in email. By allowing Eudora to display ads, you get almost the same features of Eudora in Paid mode, for free! The advertising simply helps us recover some costs.A third option is to switch over to a less powerful version of Eudora, that has no ads, and is free.To switch modes of Eudora, please use the “Payment & Registration” item in the Help menu. To learn more about the three modes, click on the “Tell Me More” button below.
