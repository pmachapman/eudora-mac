<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Using Staionery</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3>Using Stationery</H3><P>(Sponsored and Paid modes only)</P><P>A "stationery message," also called just "stationery,"   is a predefined or "canned" outgoing message that you create as a   template for sending multiple outgoing messages, in order to avoid repetitive   typing, or to create a custom look and feel that you want to use with either   all of your outgoing messages or selected ones only.</P><P>Stationery messages are stored in stationery files. A stationery file can contain   a sales letter, or a "bounceback" message telling people that you   are on vacation, or any "boilerplate" text that you would normally   send over and over. A stationery file can also serve as a foundation for all   your messages, in which you set up custom fonts, signatures, priorities, formatting,   and other message options that give you a consistent look and feel or a customized,   personal touch to your email.</P><P><B>Note:</B> Your stationery files are stored in your Stationery Folder, located   in your Eudora Folder that's stored in your Documents folder. You <I>must</I>   keep your stationery files in this folder in order to use the stationery features   described below.</P><H4>Creating New Stationery</H4><P>There are two ways to create a new stationery file. The first uses the Stationery   window, and the second uses the <B>File&gt;Save As...</B> command.</P><P>To create a new stationery file using the Stationery window, do the following:</P><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Window&gt;Stationery</B>. The Stationery window is displayed.</LI>     <BR><BR>    <LI>Click the <B>New</B> button. A new Untitled stationery item appears, with     an associated icon.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Type a name for the stationery item in the highlighted edit box and press     <B>Return</B>. (If the edit box is not highlighted, click once on the box     and after a short pause, the box is highlighted.)</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>With the new stationery item still highlighted (click once on the icon if     it is not), click the <B>Edit</B> button. A new message window is opened for     the stationery file.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Enter the stationery information you want to include in this message. Fill     in the header fields if desired, type any message body text you want, and     make any selections on the icon bar you want.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click the <B>Save</B> button in the upper right-hand corner (normally labeled     Send or Queue in new outgoing messages, but labeled Save in stationery messages).     The stationery file is saved.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Close the stationery message window.</LI></OL><P>To create a new stationery file using the <B>File&gt;Save As...</B> command,   do the following:</P><OL>  <LI>Open a new message window (<B>Message&gt;New Message</B>) and fill it out     the way you want the stationery to appear (fill in header text and body text     and make icon bar selections as desired).</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Select <B>File&gt;Save As...</B> to display the Save As dialog.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Name the file, and click the <B>Stationery</B> checkbox to turn it on. Click     the <B>Go To</B> <B>Stationery Folder</B> button (you <I>must</I> keep the     file in your Stationery Folder, located in your Eudora Folder that's     under your Documents folder).</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click the <B>Save</B> button to create the stationery file. The stationery     file is saved.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>You may now close and discard the original message.</LI></OL><H4>Modifying an Existing Stationery File</H4><P>To modify an existing stationery file, do the following:</P><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Window&gt;Stationery</B>. The Stationery window is displayed.</LI>     <BR><BR>    <LI>Click once on the icon for the stationery item you wish to modify, to highlight     it.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click the <B>Edit</B> button. The stationery message window for that stationery     is opened.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Modify the stationery as desired, and click the <B>Save</B> button in the     upper right corner.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Close the stationery message window when you are finished.</LI></OL><H4>Removing an Existing Stationery File</H4><P>To remove an existing stationery file, do the following:</P><P><B>Note:</B> Eudora does not prompt you to confirm the removal of a stationery   file.</P><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Window&gt;Stationery</B>. The Stationery window is displayed.</LI>     <BR><BR>    <LI>Click once on the icon for the stationery item you wish to delete, to highlight     it.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click the <B>Remove</B> button. The stationery item is removed.</LI></OL><H4>Sending and Replying to Messages with Stationery</H4><P>To send a new message using a stationery file, use one of these methods:</P><UL>  <LI>Select the stationery item from the <B>Message&gt;New Message With</B> submenu.</LI></UL>  <BR><UL>    <LI>Open the Stationery window (<B>Window&gt;Stationery</B>) and double-click     on the stationery icon.</LI></UL><P>In either case, a new message window opens with that stationery. Edit the message   as desired&mdash;header fields, message body, icon bar selections&mdash;and Send   or Queue the message.</P><P>To reply to a message using stationery, use one of these methods:</P><UL>  <LI>Select or open the message you wish to reply to, and select the desired     stationery item from the <B>Message&gt;Reply With</B> submenu. Edit your reply     as desired and Send or Queue the message.</LI></UL>    <BR><UL>   <LI>Create a filter (<B>Window&gt;Filters</B>) using the <B>Reply With</B> filter     action (selected from one of the <B>Actions</B> popups), and select the desired     stationery file from the stationery popup next to the <B>Reply With</B> action     popup. Any incoming message meeting the filter criteria is automatically replied     to with the selected stationery (this is how you set up an "I'm     on vacation" automatic response).</LI></UL><P>To instruct Eudora to use a particular stationery for all of your outgoing   messages by default, select the stationery file from the <B>Stationery</B> popup   in the Composing Mail Settings (<B>Special&gt;Settings...&gt;Composing Mail</B>),   for your dominant personality only, or in the Personality Extras Settings (<B>Special&gt;Settings...&gt;Personality   Extras</B>), for any of your personalities. Or, select <B>None</B> from that   popup to specify no default stationery for the given personality.</P><P><B>Note:</B> When you use stationery, the signature you stored when you created   that stationery file overrides any other signature settings, except that you   can make the final decision on what signature to use by selecting it from the   <B>Signature</B> popup in the message composition window before you send or   queue the message. Also, be careful when using stationery with multiple personalities,   as you may run into "personality conflicts."
