<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Modifiers and Shortcuts</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><h1>Modifiers</h1><P>Many operations in Eudora can be implemented by holding down one or more "modifier"   keys. Eudora uses the <B>Shift</B>, <B>Option</B>, <B>Command</B>, and <B>Control</B>   keys as modifiers. If you use a modifier key while you pull down a Eudora menu,   the menu shows the names of the modified commands. See the "Menus" chapter in   the online Eudora User Manual for full descriptions of each menu command and   its modifications, along with their functions.</P><P>Two lists are given below. The first is a list of all those modifiers that   are not reflected in Eudora's menus. The second is a list of all those   modifiers that are. Here are the modifiers not shown in the Eudora menus:</P><P><B>Shift + Open Eudora</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Open Eudora in "offline" mode, ie. open Eudora but do not check for mail, even if a mail-checking interval   is set. (You must hold down the <B>Shift</B> key until Eudora is fully started.   You open Eudora by selecting Eudora from the Dock or by double-clicking   on the Eudora application icon.)</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Shift + Delete/Transfer</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Do not open the next message after deleting or transferring the current   message.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Shift + Sort</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Add or remove the column as an extra sort criterion. This lets you   unsort or sort while preserving the previous sort(s). You can thus sort by sender,   then within sender by date, then within date by subject, then unsort by subject   and preserve the sort by sender and the sub-sort by date.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Shift + To:/Cc:/Bcc:</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>From the Address Book, do not bring the composition window to the   front after inserting the nickname.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Shift + Directory Services</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Open the Directory Services window with the selected text in the <B>Enter   query</B> field and perform the query.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Shift + click on globe icon in Directory Services window</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>List all servers except the reference list of Ph servers. That is,   list the "Configured server," the "Servers used recently," and the "LDAP servers,"   but do not list the Ph servers. (To list all servers, including the Ph list,   simply click on the globe icon, without using the Shift key.)</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Shift + drag selected text</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Copy and paste the selected text to the destination but without including   any style information.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Option + Transfer</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Put a copy of the current message in the selected mailbox and leave   the original (current) message where it is.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Option + Forward</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Forward the message without using quote characters.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Option + Queue/Send</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Open the Change Queueing dialog.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Option + Notify Sender</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Remove the return receipt request but do not notify the sender.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Option + Make Address Book Entry...</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Create a nickname consisting of the sender of the message and all   the original recipients (or just the sender if the <B>Reply to all By default</B>   setting is turned off in the Replying Settings).</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Option + To:/Cc:/Bcc:</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>From the Address Book, insert the full address instead of the nickname   (or don't, if the <B>Expand nicknames immediately</B> setting is turned   on in the Composing Mail Settings).</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Option + drag Attachment from message window or preview pane</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Copy the attachment to another folder on your desktop.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Option + double-click on a stationery item in Stationery window</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Open the stationery file for editing.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Option + click on a mailbox size display</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Compact all mailboxes.

(To   save them in standard nickname format, just do the drag without the Option key.)</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Click on a mailbox column header (in a mailbox window)</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Sort the messages in that mailbox by that column. Use <B>Option +   click</B> to sort in descending order, or <B>Shift + click</B> to add or remove   the column as an extra sort criterion (see <B>Shift + Sort</B> above).</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Control + Command + click Attachment</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Open the folder on your Macintosh that holds the attachment, and highlight   the attachment.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Command + click on Attachment name, icon, or picture</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Open or launch the attachment (same as a simple double-click).</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Command + click on URL</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Open your web browser or other appropriate application and go to the   URL (same as a simple double-click on the URL).</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Command + click on server URL in servers list in Directory Services window</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Go to that server to perform a query.
