<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Checking for and Receiving Mail</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3>Checking for and Receiving Mail</H3><P>You can check for new mail manually, or set up Eudora to automatically check   as often as you want. </P><H4>Checking Mail Manually</H4><P>To check mail manually, do one of the following:</P><UL><LI>Select <B>File&gt;Check Mail</B></LI></UL><BR><UL><LI>Click the <B>Check Mail</B> button on the main toolbar</LI></UL><BR><UL><LI>Press <B>Command+M</B></LI></UL><P>If you have new messages, Eudora transfers them one by one. Depending on the   options you have set, a "new mail" alert is displayed, and the <B>In</B>   mailbox opens with your new messages at the bottom.</P><P>If you have multiple personalities (email accounts) set up and you want their   mail checked each time you do a manual check, then for each account or "personality,"   turn on the <B>Check mail on manual checks</B> option in the Personalities Settings   (<B>Special&gt;Settings...&gt;Personalities</B>).</P><P>To manually check mail for one or more of your multiple personalities at any   time (Sponsored and Paid modes only), and not just when you check mail for your   dominant account as above, do the following:</P><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Window&gt;Personalities</B>. The Personalities window is displayed.</LI><BR>    <BR>    <LI>Select the personalities for which you want to check mail: Click once on     an icon to select one personality. To select a range, use the <B>Shift</B>     key, or drag-select. Use the <B>Command</B> key to make disjoint selections.</LI><BR>    <BR>    <LI>Click the <B>Check Mail</B> button at the bottom of the Personalities window.     Enter your password(s) if necessary, as described further below. Eudora checks     mail for each of your selected personalities, in sequence.</LI></OL><H4>Checking Mail Automatically</H4><P>To set up automatic mail checks:</P><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Special&gt;Settings...</B> and click on the <B>Checking Mail</B>     icon in the scroll list at the left of the Settings dialog.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>In the large box in the field <B>Check for mail every ? minutes</B>, type     in the number of minutes you want Eudora to wait between mail checks. For     example, if you enter 15, then Eudora checks for mail every 15 minutes.</LI><BR>    <BR>    <LI>Click the small checkbox next to the field to turn the setting on.</LI><BR>    <BR>    <LI>Click the <B>OK</B> button in the Settings dialog to save your changes and     close the dialog.</LI></OL><P>Eudora checks for mail at the intervals you have requested.</P><P>If you have multiple personalities set up (Sponsored and Paid modes only) and   you want their mail checked automatically at certain intervals, open the Personalities   Settings (<B>Special&gt;Settings...&gt; Personalities</B>) and for each account   or "personality," click the <B>Check for mail every ? minutes</B>   option and enter your desired interval. You can have different mail checking   intervals for different accounts, thus staggering your mail checks.</P><P><B>Tip:</B> To control when you receive mail, turn off automatic checking and   use manual checking only. If you want Eudora to check for your mail at regular   intervals, turn on automatic checking and enter a comfortable interval. We recommend   15 minutes as a good minimum interval. Checking mail more frequently can put   an unnecessary strain on your incoming mail server.</P><H4>Entering Your Password</H4><P>The first time you open Eudora and check for new mail, you must enter your   password (for each account for which you are checking mail).</P><OL>  <LI>When the Password dialog opens, type your password in the text box. The     characters of your password are displayed as bullets (&bull;). </LI><BR><BR>   <LI>If you make a mistake, backspace and type the correct password.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Press <B>Return</B> or click the <B>OK</B> button. Eudora then checks your     mail.</LI></OL><P><B>Tip:</B> Capitalization matters in passwords. Type characters in their correct   case (upper or lower, with or without the <B>Shift</B> key), and also be sure   your <B>Caps Lock</B> key isn't down.</P>    <P>  For additional help, visit the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport">Eudora Tech Support pages</a> for full manuals,   helpful tutorials and a searchable knowledge base.</p> </BODY></HTML>
