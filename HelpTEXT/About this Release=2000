In Internet communication, emoticons such as smiley faces can add an extra level of context to email messages. See the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/manuals.html">New Features Guide</a> for more information about using emoticons.</p><BR><p><b>ScamWatch</b></p><p>Many email scams use misleading URLs to trick users into clicking their links. What appears to be a legitimate web site address often hides a malicious URL link.</p><p>Eudora now features URL protection, which makes it easy to determine if a URL is legitimate before you click on it. You will be warned if the URL is potentially deceptive. See the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/manuals.html">New Features Guide</a> for more information about ScamWatch</p><BR><p><b>Enhanced IMAP support</b></p><p> Eudora 6.2 speeds up deletion of IMAP message and ads better support for working offline. When an IMAP message is deleted, it is immediately hidden from view. At a later time, all messages marked for deletion are removed from the server at one time. This allows IMAP messages to be deleted when you do not have an active connection to the mail server. See the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/manuals.html">New Features Guide</a> for more information about IMAP improvements</p><BR><p><b>Launch iChat directly from the Eudora Address Book</b></p><p>You can now innitiate an iChat with someone in your Eudora Address Book. Highlight an entry in your Address Book. If that user has a username listed in the <b>iChat</b> field under the <b>Home</b> tab, the iChat button will be enabled next to the To:, Cc: and Bcc: buttons. Clicking that button will launch iChat and open a new chat window with that user.Again, see the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/manuals.html">New Features Guide</a> for more information about ichat from within Eudora.</p><BR><p><b>Live Search</b></p><p> Open Search windows are now updated when new mail arrives. Thus you can think of search windows as 'Virtual Mailboxes'. For example, leave a search window open for "Status is unread" and the results of that search will continually update to show you all your unread mail.</p><BR><p><b>Dock Icon shows the number of unread messages in Eudora</b></p><p>The icon in the Dock will now show the number of unread messages in open mailboxes. This is helpful if you have Eudora hidden and mail arrives into an open mailbox, or a filter moves mail to a mailbox and opens that mailbox. The lower-right corner of the icon will change to show the number of unread messages in these open mailboxes.</p><p> <font color="#007700">GREEN</font> - means the number has increasedsince you last did anything in Eudora.<br></div><div><font color="#0000FF">BLUE</font> - means it has not.</div></p><p> You can use &lt;x-eudora-setting:396&gt; to adjust this feature.</p><BR><p><b>Improved SSL compatibility</b></p><p>Eudora 6.2 provides greater compatibility and improved handling of SSL connections. </p></HTML>
