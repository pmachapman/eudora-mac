<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Creating and Saving a Message</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3>Creating and Saving a Message</H3><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Message&gt;New Message</B> (or press <B>Command+N</B>, or click     the <B>New Message</B> button on the main toolbar). A new message composition     window opens.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Type an email address (or nickname you created in the Address Book) in the <B>To:</B> field.     Separate multiple addresses and nicknames with commas.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Press <B>Tab</B> to move to the <B>Subject:</B> field and type the subject     of your message (optional but useful and good netiquette).</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Press <B>Tab</B> to move to the <B>Cc:</B> field and type one or more email     addresses (optional&mdash;for sending carbon copies to other recipients).     Separate multiple addresses with commas. (Cc's are public copies, meaning the     addresses are visible to the recipients.)</LI>  <BR><BR>    <LI>Press <B>Tab</B> to move to the <B>Bcc:</B> field and type one or more email     addresses (optional&mdash;for sending blind carbon copies to other recipients).     Separate multiple addresses with commas. (Bcc's are private copies, meaning the    addresses are not visible to the recipients.)</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Press <B>Tab</B> to move to the body of the message and type your message     text.</LI></OL><P>To create the message under a different "personality," or email account   (if you have multiple personalities set up), select the personality from the   Personality popup in the <B>From:</B> field, or from the <B>Message&gt;Change&gt;Personality</B>   submenu.</P><P>To save your message at any time, select <B>File&gt;Save</B>. Your message   will be saved in the Out mailbox marked with a blue bullet (&bull;), meaning   that it is sendable. You can continue writing the message, or close it and come   back to it later.</P><H3>Sending or Queueing a Message</H3><P>There are two ways to send mail with Eudora: you can send a message immediately,   or put it in a queue (waiting list) to be sent later. To specify which option   you want Eudora to perform by default, take the following steps before you create   a new message:</P><OL>  <LI>Select the <B>Special&gt;Settings...</B> command to open the Settings 	dialog.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click on the <B>Sending Mail</B> category in the scrolling list on the left.</LI><BR>    <BR>    <LI>Turn on (check) the <B>Immediate send</B> option to send messages immediately,     or turn it off (uncheck it) to put messages into the message queue to be sent     later.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click <B>OK</B> to save your setting and close the Settings dialog.</LI></OL><P>Now, in the open message window of a new message you have just created, click   the message delivery button in the upper right corner of the window: it is marked   either <B>Send</B> or <B>Queue</B> depending on your selection in the numbered   steps above. If you click the button and it is marked <B>Send</B>, the message   is sent immediately. If you click the button and it is marked <B>Queue</B>,   the message is transferred to your Out mailbox and marked "Q," meaning   it is queued and ready to be sent.</P><P>To send all the messages that are queued in your Out mailbox in one step, select   <B>File&gt;Send Queued Messages</B>.</P><H3>Specifying the Time to Send</H3><P>Eudora can send a message at a specific time in the future (Eudora must be   running at the specified time).</P><OL>  <LI>Compose the message that you want to send at a specific time.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>With the message open or selected, select the <B>Message&gt;Change&gt;Queueing...</B>     command. (Or, with the message open, hold down the <B>Option</B> key and click     the <B>Send</B> or <B>Queue</B> button in the upper right corner of the message     window.)</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>In the <B>Change Queueing</B> dialog that appears, click the desired button.     If you click <B>On or after</B>, type the time and date     you want the message to be sent.</LI><BR><BR>   <LI>Click <B>OK</B>.</LI></OL><P>If you specify a later time and date, Eudora sends the message at that   time if it is running. If it is not running at that time, as soon as you   launch Eudora after the time has passed, Eudora sends the message.</P><H3>Taking a Message Out of the Queue</H3><P>If you have a timed or queued message that you decide you don't want to   send, you can stop it ("unqueue" it), as long as it hasn't already   been sent.</P><OL>  <LI>Open the Out mailbox.</LI><BR><BR>      <LI>Select the message you don't want to send.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Select the <B>Message&gt;Change&gt;Queueing...</B> command.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click the <B>Don't Send</B> button in the <B>Change Queueing</B> dialog.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click <B>OK</B>.</LI></OL><P>The message is returned to the sendable state, marked with a blue bullet (&bull;)   in the Status column of the message summary. You can send it later, or you can   discard it.</P>  <P>  For additional help, visit the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport">Eudora Tech Support pages</a> for full manuals,   helpful tutorials and a searchable knowledge base.</p> </BODY></HTML>
