<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Using the Address Book</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3>Using the Address Book</H3><P>The Address Book, like an address book you keep in your pocket or purse, is   where you keep information about individuals or groups that you correspond with.   The Address Book lets you keep this information stored in one handy place and   also lets you conveniently send mail to these individuals or groups.</P><P>Each entry in the Address Book includes a "nickname" (shorthand name) for a   person or group, their full email address(es), a real name, any contact information,   notes, and other personal information. You can also use the Address Book to   put nicknames on your Quick Recipient List, and to address a new message. Further,   you can use the Address Book to create multiple nickname files (folders) to   organize your nicknames. Last, you use the Address Book to remove nickname entries   and files.</P><P>Begin by opening the Address Book: Select <B>Window&gt;Address Book</B>, or   click the <B>Address Book</B> button on the main toolbar, or press <B>Command+L</B>.</P><H4>Adding a Person to the Address Book</H4><P>To add a person to your address book, do the following:</P><OL>  <LI>If you have multiple Address Books, choose the address book where you want     this entry to reside.</LI><br><br>    <LI>Click the <B>New Nickname</B> button at the bottom of the list.
