You can then open that mailbox at any time just   by clicking on its toolbar button.

(To remove the toolbar button at   some later time, hold down the <B>Command</B> key and click the toolbar button,   then click <B>Remove Button</B> from the Toolbar Button Creation dialog.)</P><P>  For additional help, visit the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport">Eudora Tech Support pages</a> for full manuals,   helpful tutorials and a searchable knowledge base.</p> </BODY></HTML>
