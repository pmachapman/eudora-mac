If the computer that runs this server has the right software,   you can change your account password right from within Eudora. If you have multiple   password-controlled accounts and the above condition applies for each, you can   change the password for each account in Eudora.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>   <P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;To change your password(s), do one of the following:</P>  <UL>    <LI>To change your password if you have only one email account, or to change       the password for your Dominant account if you have multiple email accounts       multiple personalities), select the <B>Special&gt;Change Password...</B>       command.</LI>  </UL>  <BLOCKQUOTE>     <P>OR</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <UL>    <LI>To change the password for one or more of your personalities if you have       multiple personalities, do the following:</LI>  </UL></BLOCKQUOTE><OL TYPE="a">  <BLOCKQUOTE>        <OL TYPE="a">        <LI>Select <B>Window&gt;Personalities</B> to open the Personalities 			window.</LI><BR><BR>        <LI>Select the personality or personalities whose password(s) you wish           to change: use the <B>Shift</B> key to select a range and the <B>Command</B>           key to make disjoint selections.</LI><BR><BR>        <LI>Select the <B>Special&gt;Change Password for Selected Personalities...</B>           command</LI>      </OL>  </BLOCKQUOTE></OL><BLOCKQUOTE>  	2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Password dialog that displays, type your current password (for   the personality) and click OK. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another dialog appears, asking you for your new password.</P>  <P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Type your new password and click OK </P> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To verify the change, Eudora asks you for the new password again.</P>  <P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Type your new password again and click OK.</P> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eudora tells you if your password is accepted.</P>   <P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you selected multiple personalities in step 1, then repeat steps     2 through 4 above for each selected personality as you are prompted.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H4>Tips:</H4><UL>  <LI>The above procedure works only if the incoming mail server is running a     compatible password-change server. For information about these servers, see "Sources" the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/manuals.html">online Eudora User Manual</a>.<BR>    <BR>  </LI>  <LI>For your own protection, many password servers are strict about passwords.     When you choose a new password, make sure it's at least six characters     long and is not a dictionary word, name, date, familiar acronym, or anything     else that could be guessed. Some servers require that you have at least one     number or symbol in your password, and you may want to do that even if it     is not required.<BR>    <BR>  </LI>  <LI>Depending on the password server you are using, the password can be up to     30 characters, but it is normally only 7 or 8.</LI></UL>  <P>  For additional help, visit the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport">Eudora Tech Support pages</a> for full manuals,   helpful tutorials and a searchable knowledge base.</p> </BODY></HTML>
