<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Creating Filters</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3>Creating Filters</H3><P>Note: If you are using Eudora in Light mode, only a limited number of functions   are available.</P><P>Many of Eudora's email management functions can be automated with a "filter,"   which you can think of as a sort of "valet" or "butler"   that performs certain operations on your messages behind the scenes, automatically.   You can set up these filters for incoming messages or outgoing messages, or   both.</P><P>You can do such things as the following, on incoming messages, for example:</P><UL><LI>Transfer all the messages from your children into a Personal mailbox.</LI></UL><BR>  <UL><LI>Automatically reply with a stationery message saying that you are "on     vacation."</LI></UL><BR>  <UL><LI>Play a sound when you receive a message from someone important.</LI></UL><BR>  <UL><LI>Raise the priority on an important incoming message and also change its     label color to red for "Hot," for example.</LI></UL>    <P>There are two ways to create a filter. One is simple, and the other is detailed.   Starting with an existing email message, you can create a simple transfer filter   using the <B>Make Filter</B> dialog (<B>Special&gt;Make Filter...</B>). You   can create a detailed filter that looks at multiple aspects of a message and   performs multiple actions on it by using the <B>Filters</B> window (<B>Window&gt;Filters</B>).</P><P>To create a simple transfer filter (one that automatically transfers messages   to other mailboxes), do the following:</P><OL>  <LI>Select or open the email message that contains the information you want     to use to create the filter (sender's address, recipient's address,     or Subject words, for example).</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Select the <B>Special&gt;Make Filter...</B> command. The Make Filter dialog     is displayed.</LI><BR><BR>       <LI>Check the fields of the Make Filter dialog to make sure the information     is as you want it, and edit if necessary. (For more information on these fields,     see the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/manuals.html"> online Eudora User Manual.</a>)</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click <B>Create Filter</B> to add this filter to your list of filters in     Eudora, or click <B>Add Details</B> to display the <B>Filters</B> window so     you can make this filter more detailed (see below).</LI></OL><P>To create a detailed filter, do the following:</P><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Window&gt;Filters</B>. The Filters window is displayed, and your     existing filters, if any, are listed in the scroll window on the left.</LI> <BR>    <BR>    <LI>Click the <B>New</B> button, or select an existing filter. </LI>  <P>Filters are automatically named based on the criteria for the filter. They     are invoked in order from top to bottom, and you can re-order them by dragging     a filter up or down in the list. If you are creating a new filter, "Untitled"     will change to what you enter in the <B>Header</B> field, and will appear     after you close the Filters window.</P>  <LI>Select the options for how you want the filter to be used: You can set it     as an automatic filter to be invoked on any <B>Incoming</B> and/or <B>Outgoing</B>     messages, and as a <B>Manual</B> filter that can be invoked when you select     the <B>Special&gt;Filter Messages</B> command. Any combination of these options     works.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Define the criteria for the filter: Use the header item popups and the text     fields to specify which header items should include a particular string of     text. You can define two related terms for the criteria so that your filter     is as specific as possible (for details, see the "Filter Criteria"     section of <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/manuals.html"> online Eudora User Manual.</a>).</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Define the action or actions to be taken on messages that fit the criteria     (for details, see the "Filter Actions" section of the online Eudora     User Manual).</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Select <B>File&gt;Save</B> to save your changes to the filters. </LI></OL><P>When the filters are invoked (automatically or manually), each message is matched   against each filter, and messages that meet a filter's criteria are acted   on as specified until a <B>Transfer To</B> action is performed or a <B>Skip   Rest</B> action is encountered. At that point, the next message is filtered.</P><P>To invoke your manual filters, select the messages you want to be filtered   (acted on), then select <B>Special&gt;Filter Messages</B>.</P><H4>Example: Creating a Detailed Filter</H4><P>Let's assume you want all the email from people at QUALCOMM to go into   a mailbox named "QUALCOMM Mail." Assume the email addresses of all   these people will have the string <B>qualcomm.com</B> in them.</P><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Window&gt;Filters</B>. The Filters window is displayed.</LI><BR>    <BR>    <LI>Click the <B>New</B> button. An Untitled filter is created.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Check the <B>Incoming</B> box, if it is not already checked.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>From the first <B>Header</B> popup, select "<B>From:</B>".</LI>  <BR><BR>  <LI>Be sure the popup to the lower left says <B>contains</B>.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Type <B>qualcomm.com</B> in the text field below the Header popup (next     to the <B>contains</B> popup).</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>From the first <B>Actions</B> popup, select <B>Transfer To</B>.</LI><BR>    <BR>    <LI>From the <B>Transfer</B> menu, select the <B>QUALCOMM Mail</B> mailbox.     If the mailbox doesn't already exist, select <B>New...</B> from the <B>Transfer</B>     menu and make one. </LI><BR><BR>   <LI>Select <B>File&gt;Save</B> to save your filters.</LI></OL><P>Now when you check your mail, any email from people with <B>qualcomm.com</B>   in their email address will automatically go into your <B>QUALCOMM Mail</B>   mailbox.</P><P><B>Note:</B> You can also create this straightforward transfer filter from   an existing email message (having <B>qualcomm.com</B> in the sender's or   a recipient's address) using the Make Filter dialog (<B>Special&gt;Make   Filter...</B>). See those instructions above. The Filters window lets you apply   multiple actions to a message and select multiple criteria for deciding what   to do with it. Hence the advantage of "detailed" filters for powerful   control over how your email is managed.</P><P>  For additional help, visit the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport">Eudora Tech Support pages</a> for full manuals,   helpful tutorials and a searchable knowledge base.</p> </BODY></HTML>
