<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Attaching a File</TITLE></HEAD><BODY> <H3>Attaching a Document to a Message</H3><P>You can send any documents along with your Eudora messages. </P><OL>  <LI>With a new message window open, select <B>Message&gt;Attach Document...</B>     (or click the <B>Attach Document...</B> button on the main toolbar). The standard     file selection dialog appears.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Navigate through the dialog until you find the document you want to send,     then select that document.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click the <B>Attach</B> button in the dialog.</LI></OL><P>The file you selected is listed in the <B>Attachments:</B> field of the new   message window. To send more than one attachment, repeat steps 1 through 3.   All attachments will be listed in the <B>Attachments:</B> field.</P><P>You can also attach files to a message by dragging them from the Finder onto   the message window.</P><P>To remove any attached document from a message before the message is sent,   select the attachment in the Attachments: field and either press the <B>Delete</B>   key or select <B>Edit&gt;Clear</B>.</P><P><B>Note:</B> The <B>Message&gt;Attach</B> submenu is for attaching files created using Eudora plug-ins, if these plug-ins are installed.   For more details, see &quot;Using Eudora Plug-ins&quot; in the online Eudora   User Manual.</P><H4>Inserting the Contents of a Text Document Into a Message</H4><P>You can insert the contents of any text file into your Eudora messages, so   that the text is sent right in the Eudora message itself, rather than the file   being sent as an external attachment.</P><OL>  <LI>With a new message window open, put the cursor where you want to insert     the text, then select <B>Edit&gt;Text&gt;Insert Graphic...</B>. The standard    file selection dialog     appears.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Navigate through the dialog until you find the document whose text you want     to insert, then select that document.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click the <B>Insert</B> button in the dialog.</LI></OL><P>The text is inserted into your message and can be edited as if you had typed   it or copied and pasted it.</P><H4>Receiving an Attached Document</H4><P>After you first install Eudora, Eudora automatically places any attachments   you receive into a folder called "Attachments Folder" inside your   Eudora Folder (in your Documents Folder). If you want these attachments to go someplace   else, you need to assign an attachment folder. To do so, take the following   steps.</P><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Special&gt;Settings...</B> to open the Settings dialog, then click     the <B>Attachments</B> category in the scroll list on the left.</LI><BR><BR>      <LI>Click the long button to the right of <B>Attachment Folder</B>. A standard     file selection dialog is displayed.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Follow the instructions in the dialog to select the folder you want to use, then click the <B>Choose</B> button.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Click the <B>OK</B> button in the Settings dialog.</LI></OL><P>You can also specify whether attachments should be deleted when their corresponding   messages are deleted. To do this, turn on (check) the <B>Trash attachments with   messages</B> box in the Attachments panel of the Settings dialog.</P><P><B>Tip:</B> You can set up a filter that will move incoming attachments to   a folder you specify if the messages carrying the attachments meet certain criteria.   This folder can be different from your assigned attachment folder. For more   details, see the online Eudora User Manual, under the <B>Move Attachments</B>   filter action in the "Filter Actions" section ("Filtering Messages").</P><H4>Opening an Attached Document</H4><P>When you receive a document attached to a message, you can open the document   directly in Eudora.</P><OL>  <LI>Open the message the document is attached to, or display the message in     the message preview pane.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>In the open message window or the message preview pane, find the name, icon,     or picture associated with the attached document.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI><B>Double-click</B> or <B>Command-click</B> on the name, icon, or picture,     or click once on any of these items and choose <B>File&gt;Open     Selection</B>.</LI></OL><P>Eudora starts the proper application and asks it to open the document. If the Finder   doesn&#146;t know which application to use, it asks you to locate the right   one.</P><P><B>Tip:</B> If you want to open the attachment file in your web browser, click   once on the attachment name, icon, or picture and select <B>File&gt;Open in   Browser</B>, if this command is available (this depends on whether the file   is browser-compatible).</P><H4> Viewing a Graphic Attachment as a Picture in the Message</H4><P>You can set up Eudora so that when you receive a message with a graphic-file   attachment, the picture contained in the graphic file is displayed right in   your open message window or the message preview pane, so that you don't   have to take the extra step of opening the graphic file to see what's in   it. To do this:</P><OL>  <LI>Select <B>Special&gt;Settings...</B> to open the Settings dialog.<BR>    <BR>  </LI>  <LI>Click the <B>Fonts &amp; Display</B> category icon in the scroll list on     the left.<BR>    <BR>  </LI>  <LI>Turn on the <B>Display graphics in messages</B> option by checking the box.<BR>    <BR>  </LI>  <LI>Click the <B>OK</B> button to save your setting and close the Settings dialog.</LI></OL><P>Now when you receive a message containing a graphics attachment, you can open the message, or display it in the preview pane, and right in the message window or preview pane itself you will see the picture that the graphics file contains.</P>	<BR>  For additional help, visit the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport">Eudora Tech Support pages</a> for full manuals,   helpful tutorials and a searchable knowledge base.</p> </BODY></HTML>
