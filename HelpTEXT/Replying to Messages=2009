<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Replying to a Message</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3>Replying to a Message</H3><P>You can reply to a message when you want to respond to the sender (and possibly   recipients) of the message.</P><OL>  <LI>Select or open the message to which you want to reply.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Select <B>Message&gt;Reply</B>, or click the <B>Reply</B> button on the     main toolbar, or press <B>Command+R</B>. Eudora automatically completes the     <B>To</B> and <B>Subject</B> fields and the message body using the information     from the original message. Each line from the original message is preceded     by an excerpt bar (this is referred to as "quoting"). The excerpt     bars offset the original text, so readers can distinguish your text from the     text you're replying to. (Styled text is quoted with left sidebars, also     called excerpt bars, which are continuous vertical bars: "<B>|</B>".)</LI>  <BR><BR>  <LI>Remove those parts of the original text that you don't want to include     in your reply, and add your own text.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>When you are done, click <B>Send</B> (or <B>Queue</B>).</LI></OL><P>You can use the Replying Settings options (<B>Special&gt;Settings...&gt;Replying</B>)   to specify whether you want your reply messages to include only the sender of   the original message, or the sender and all the recipients.</P><P><B>Tip:</B> To toggle that reply setting temporarily, hold down the <B>Option</B> key and   select <B>Message&gt;Reply To All</B>.</P><P><B>Tip:</B> To reply quoting only the selected text, hold down the <B>Shift</B> key and   select <B>Message&gt;Reply Quoting Selection</B>.</P><H4>Forwarding a Message</H4><P>You can forward a message when you want someone else to read it and possibly   respond to you. Note that when you forward a message, not just the message body   but also the header fields of the original message are included.</P><OL>  <LI>Select or open the message you want to forward.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Select <B>Message&gt;Forward</B>, or click the <B>Forward</B> button on     the main toolbar. Eudora automatically completes the <B>Subject</B> field     and the message body using the information from the original message. The     Subject is preceded by "Fwd:" and a space. Each line from the original     message (including the header lines) is preceded by a right-angle bracket     marker, "&gt;" (this is referred to as "quoting"). The     "&gt;" markers offset the original text, so readers can distinguish     your text from the text you're forwarding. (Styled text is quoted with     left sidebars, also called excerpt bars, which are continuous vertical bars:     "<B>|</B>".)</LI><BR><BR>  <LI>The cursor is positioned in the <B>To</B> field: fill in the addresses of     the people to whom you want to forward the message.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Edit the existing text as needed, and add your own text if desired.</LI><BR>    <BR>    <LI>When you are done, click <B>Send</B> (or <B>Queue</B>).</LI></OL><H4>Redirecting a Message</H4><P>You can redirect a message when you want someone to read it and respond to   the original sender. When you redirect a message, you "bounce" it   to someone else: you remove yourself from the communication loop and effectively   change the message to be one from the original sender to your redirected recipient   (with you simply as the "handoff" person in the middle). Thus, when   your redirected recipient responds to the message, the reply goes not to you   but to the original sender.</P><OL>  <LI>Select or open the message you want to redirect.<BR>    <BR>  </LI>  <LI>Select <B>Message&gt;Redirect</B>, or click the <B>Redirect</B> button on     the main toolbar. Eudora automatically completes the <B>From</B> and <B>Subject</B>     fields and the message body using the information from the original message.     The <B>From</B> field also includes the words "by way of" followed     by your name or email address. This way the recipient knows who redirected     the message (you).<BR>    <BR>  </LI>  <LI>The cursor is positioned in the <B>To:</B> field. Fill in the addresses of     the people to whom you want to redirect the message.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>Edit the existing text as needed, and add your own text if desired.</LI><BR><BR>    <LI>When you are done, click <B>Send</B> (or <B>Queue</B>).</LI></OL><P><B>Note:</B> It is good email courtesy to not do much editing of the message   you&'re redirecting. If you must add comments, we recommend that you enclose   them in square brackets, [ ], and include your initials: [Don: Please reply   to this right away. SD]</P><H4>Selecting a URL Helper Application</H4><P>Any string of text that Eudora recognizes as a "hot link," also known   as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), is active. Active URLs in incoming Eudora   messages are normally highlighted in blue text and blue underlining, and are   often enclosed by left and right angle brackets, "&lt; &gt;". You   normally <B>double-click</B> (or <B>Command-click</B>) on a URL in an incoming message to open the URL. This launches an Internet application that, for example,   opens a World Wide Web location, transfers a file, performs a gopher search,   performs a Ph, Finger, or LDAP query, etc. Typical URL prefixes include http,   ftp, gopher, ph, finger, ldap, and more.</P><P>A sample URL is &lt;http://www.qualcomm.com/eudora&gt;, which a web browser   would use to take you to QUALCOMM's main Eudora web page on the World Wide   Web. Eudora uses the OS default web browser to open this type of URL.</P>    <P>  For additional help, visit the <a href="http://www.eudora.com/techsupport">Eudora Tech Support pages</a> for full manuals,   helpful tutorials and a searchable knowledge base.</p> </BODY></HTML>
